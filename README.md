realtime-siri-mean
==================

A realtime SIRI  visualization proof of concept app with the MEAN stack and socket.io.

The Service Interface for Real Time Information or SIRI is an XML protocol to allow distributed computers to exchange real time information about public transport services and vehicles.

The MEAN stack stands for MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS and Node.js.

This project uses [btford](https://github.com/btford)'s [angular-socket-io](https://github.com/btford/angular-socket-io) and [nlaplante](https://github.com/nlaplante) / [angular-google-maps](https://github.com/nlaplante/angular-google-maps).

So far the app only shows one bus for one line of the [Tampere Public Transport SIRI interface](http://wiki.itsfactory.fi/index.php/Tampere_Public_Transport_SIRI_Interface_(Realtime_JSON_at_data.itsfactory.fi)).
